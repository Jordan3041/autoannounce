Hello everyone!

I saw a script like this somewhere but it didnt quite do exacly as I wanted, so I created my own. You can adjust this however you liike/what works for you. 

This script was created to automatically send a message in the chat every so often. The script was written so that you can change the time interval between messages. I have mine set to send a random message every 15 minutes. The script will pick a message from the list that you create, and automatically send a chat message. The reason I wanted something like this was for new people, being able to send support message while in game without having to worry about it myself. You can see in the 'message' box under the client.lua that i have set the messages to say what i wanted them to, but you can tweak that to fit your server. The color code is at the top, and the carrot '^' combined with the number will change the color. Example: ^3Hello everyone! 

If you run into any issues, let me know that way I can look into it. I have been running this on my server for the last 2 weeks and I have not had an issues at all. 

Installation:

1. Download the file from GitHub
2. Extract the files using a program like winrar, winzip, 7zip. 
3. Change the folder withe the files inside name to 'autoannounce'
4. Configure the messages/time delay however you see fit.
5. Add the folder with the files inside to your server data>resources foolder.
6. Add autoannounce to your server.cfg.

Enjoy!
